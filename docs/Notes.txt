The importance of HTML
======================

New web designers need to learn at least the three core languages:
* HTML - Essential structure 
* CSS - Page design
* JavaScript - Page behavior

==================
Basic HTML syntax
==================

HTML = HyperText Markup Language

HTML ELEMENTS:
There are 3 types of elements:
1 – Content element allows to put content in a pag (ex. <p> <h><img>)
2 – Structure elements (group content in a page - ex. <main><footer>)
3 – Document metadata elements (extra information)

HTML TAGS:
* Open tag and closing tag: <p>A paragraph text</p>
* Void tag: sits by himself don’t need a closing tag <img src=’’>

The tags can have some attributes:
* Some are specific to the elements
* Global Attributes

Two types of attributes:
* Informative - gives extra information about  the element
* Functional - gives the browser a functionality - case of href

Ex.
lang="en"
Lang is the name of the attribute
= assignment operator
"en" value

Nesting:
HTML allows to create more complicated structures by nesting an element inside another element. 

There are rules in Nesting tags:
* If a child element is open it has to close before its parent element.
