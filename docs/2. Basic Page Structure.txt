Exploring an HTML document
==========================

Browsers gives us instuments to inspect the webpages:
IE - Developer tools
Firefox - Firebug
Chrome - Webkit Inspector

For building a document we need:
* <!DOCTYPE HTML>  version of HTML we are using
* <html></html>  all elements are inside
Two regions:
* <head></head>  
What makes the html better but don't define it. 
Non visual elements that makes the page/document work.
We have: scripts, css files that styles the page, meta tags, title for accessibility.
* <body></body>  
All the visual elements 
We have: h1, main content, sidebars, footers, paragraphs
