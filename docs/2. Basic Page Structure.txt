Exploring an HTML document
==========================

Browsers gives us instuments to inspect the webpages:
IE - Developer tools
Firefox - Firebug
Chrome - Webkit Inspector

For building a document we need:
* <!DOCTYPE HTML>  version of HTML we are using
* <html></html>  all elements are inside
Two regions:
* <head></head>  
What makes the html better but don't define it. 
Non visual elements that makes the page/document work.
We have: scripts, css files that styles the page, meta tags, title for accessibility.
* <body></body>  
All the visual elements 
We have: h1, main content, sidebars, footers, paragraphs

====================
DOCTYPE Declarations
====================

Doctype tells the browser which version of html we are going to use. 

Trigger the quirks mode ensures that the page is going to be rendered properly.

The one that we need is:
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
