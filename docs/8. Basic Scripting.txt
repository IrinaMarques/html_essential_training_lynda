HTML and Javascript
====================

Javascript:
- Validating forms
- Remote scripting

Javascript comments are // comments in javascript are very important. It's very common to come back six months later or a year and forget why you wrote a function to do a certain thing. 

====================
Writting a function
====================

Functions help us to write efficient applications by grouping commonly performed tasks into a single block of code which can then be executed if it's needed. 

window.onload = function() { }
same as: when windows stop load execute this function
aplly when document loads

function displayPanel() { }
named function - I give the name I want
aplly when we call it

==============
Using the DOM
==============

DOM = Document Object Model
The DOM is a standardized way of referencing page element in HTML documents. The DOM describes the tree and also gives methods for traversing and accessing these elements programmatically.

Variable is anything I want to be. Store whatever information or objects that I wanted inside of it.

= is a assigning operator - assign a value
