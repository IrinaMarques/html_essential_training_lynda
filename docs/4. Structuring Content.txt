=======================
The value of structure
=======================

HTML allows us to structure documents in a way that illustrates the meaning of the content - semantics.
* Header: Company information
* Navigation: Site Navigation
* Main content
* Aside bar: Additional Information
* Footer: Contact Information

HTML Allows to group content together in specific sections that have semantic meaning.

Sectioning Elements:
* <heading>: <h1> ... <h6>
* <article>
* <aside>
* <nav>
* <section>

Semantic Elements:
* <header>
* <main>
* <footer>

Controlling document outlines
==============================

To see document outline:

First we have to difine what type of document outline to generate.

Fist we have to figure out each categories will be the heading, and each are h1 till h6.

<nav> element: new section that is specific to the navigation of the site

<article> element: the content of the page

<section> element

<aside> element: related to the content in the page

================
The nav element
================

http://w3.org/TR/html5

<nav></nav>

The nav element represents a section of a page that links to other pages or parts within the page, a section with navigation links.
- for major navigation inside the site
- navigate to specific areas

====================
The article element
====================

When is appropriate to use the <article> element
- individual elements that can stand alone
- when they are removed from other content they still make sense
- the article let creat a section in the outline

<article></article>

====================
The section element
====================

<section></section>

When is appropriate to use the <section> element
- thematic group of content
- including a heading as a child of the section element
- it's not a generic container element
