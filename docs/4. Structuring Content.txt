=======================
The value of structure
=======================

HTML allows us to structure documents in a way that illustrates the meaning of the content - semantics.
* Header: Company information
* Navigation: Site Navigation
* Main content
* Aside bar: Additional Information
* Footer: Contact Information

HTML Allows to group content together in specific sections that have semantic meaning.

Sectioning Elements:
* <heading>: <h1> ... <h6>
* <article>
* <aside>
* <nav>
* <section>

Semantic Elements:
* <header>
* <main>
* <footer>

==============================
Controlling document outlines
==============================

To see document outline:
http://gsnedders.html5.org/outliner

First we have to difine what type of document outline to generate.

Fist we have to figure out each categories will be the heading, and each are h1 till h6.

<nav> element: new section that is specific to the navigation of the site

<article> element: the content of the page

<section> element

<aside> element: related to the content in the page

================
The nav element
================

http://w3.org/TR/html5

<nav></nav>

The nav element represents a section of a page that links to other pages or parts within the page, a section with navigation links.
- for major navigation inside the site
- navigate to specific areas

====================
The article element
====================

When is appropriate to use the <article> element
- individual elements that can stand alone
- when they are removed from other content they still make sense
- the article let creat a section in the outline

<article></article>

====================
The section element
====================

<section></section>

When is appropriate to use the <section> element
- thematic group of content
- including a heading as a child of the section element
- it's not a generic container element

==================
The aside element
==================

<aside></aside>

The aside element it's used to represent related content
- section of a page, that consists of content that is tangentially related to the content around the aside element and which could be considered separete from that content
- pull quotes, sidebars, advertising, groups os nav elements and other content that is considered separete from the main content of the page.
- Where you place the aside matters.

================
The div element
================

<div></div>

The div tag it's used for:
- structure or group content together without passing along any type of semantic meaning.
- anonymous grouping tag don't mean anything
- allows to group up elements into a specific tag

To get more specific we can use:
* class
* id 

class is a semantic attribute: 
- meaning they pass along meaning
- help us to identify content on the page
- allows to stylistically style them
- very flexible

=======================
Other semantic element
=======================

Semantic elements: helps to create sophisticated page structures without affecting the document outline.
* main
* header
* footer

<header></header>
- representing the introductory content 
- contain the sections heading
- the pages are not limited to one header

<footer></footer>
- typically need information about its section such as who wrote it, links to related documents, copyright data
- appendices, indexes, long colophon, verbose licensing, agreements, contact information with an address element, bylines
- it's not necessary to be on the bottom of the page

<main></main>
- main content of the body of a document application
- directly related to or expands upon the central topic of a document
- only can use one in a page
- it's not a sectioning content

=====================
Using WAI-ARIA roles
=====================

http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria

Acessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA)
- accessible sites and applications

- landmark role attribute: allows screen reader, assisted devices, and other user agents to quickly scan that page content and then navigate to those specific sections when required.

Give the elements a role
Ex. 
<header role='banner'>
<nav role='navigation'>
<main role='main'>
<article role='article'>
<aside role='complementary'>
<footer role='contentinfo'>
