============================
Formatting content with HTML
============================

HTML is a markup so it uses tags to identify content on the page.

Unformatted text
<body>
 What am I?
</body>

<pre></pre> : preformatted - poems and things where the formatting is a specific way.

<i></i> : italicizes 
<b></b> : bold
<em></em> : emphasis
<strong></strong> : strongly emphasized

===============
Using headings
===============

Adding Headings
Headings goes from <h1> all way down to <h6>. 
We have to think in the structure of the document and the importance of the heading himself not the size. 

Heading: <h1> till <h6>
Denotes the level of importance of the content.

Notes:
- Limited headings in the page - Use logically
- Don't skip a series of headings - Use headings in order don't skip

=====================
Formatting paragraphs
=====================

We have to be carefull with the paragraphs because it's the default text. 

When we make two paragraphs they get a space between them. This is because all HTML elements have both top and bottom margins.

=======================
Controlling line breaks
=======================

<br>

Line break don't need a close tag
Don't get spaces between the line
Used when we need to force a hard return without creating a new paragraph.
