============================
Formatting content with HTML
============================

HTML is a markup so it uses tags to identify content on the page.

Unformatted text
<body>
 What am I?
</body>

<pre></pre> : preformatted - poems and things where the formatting is a specific way.

<i></i> : italicizes 
<b></b> : bold
<em></em> : emphasis
<strong></strong> : strongly emphasized

===============
Using headings
===============

Adding Headings
Headings goes from <h1> all way down to <h6>. 
We have to think in the structure of the document and the importance of the heading himself not the size. 

Heading: <h1> till <h6>
Denotes the level of importance of the content.

Notes:
- Limited headings in the page - Use logically
- Don't skip a series of headings - Use headings in order don't skip

=====================
Formatting paragraphs
=====================

We have to be carefull with the paragraphs because it's the default text. 

When we make two paragraphs they get a space between them. This is because all HTML elements have both top and bottom margins.

=======================
Controlling line breaks
=======================

<br>

Line break don't need a close tag
Don't get spaces between the line
Used when we need to force a hard return without creating a new paragraph.

================
Emphasizing text
================

<i></i> : italicizes 
<b></b> : bold
<em></em> : emphasis
<strong></strong> : strongly emphasized

<dl> : definition list contains two parts
<dt> : term
<dd> : definition

=============================
Displaying special characters
=============================

Some special characters can't be used to fix that problem we have to use named character entity.

Ex.
&lang; = <
&amp; = &
&amp; = &amp;amp
&copy; = copyright
&trade = trademark

======================
Controlling whitespace
======================

&nbsp; = non breaking spaces - adds whitespace
It's used to when we resize the browser one word don't break

==================
Displaying images
==================

Images are conssidered what we call replaced content, when they're encountered, the browser or user agent will use the information within that tag to replace its contents with the resource that you're asked for.
The attributes becomes important.
The image tag don't have a closing tag.

<img scr='' alt=''>
src : source - tells the browser here to go out and find that image
alt : pass along descreptive text which is representative of the image, very useful for screen reader or other assistive devices
width and height : are optional but they can be used to pass the dimensions of the image to the browser.
