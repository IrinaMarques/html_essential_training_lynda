Unordered lists
================

HTML give us thre types of lists to use:
- Unordered lists <ul></ul> open and closing tags
- Ordered lists <ol></ol> open and closing tags
- Definition lists

Lists are primarily a way of grouping information
- list <li></li> open and closing tags

Lists are great to organizing:
- menus
- form elements
- product information
- any content that needs to be group together in a related manner

==============
Ordered lists
==============

Similar to unordered list they share almost exactly the same syntax.
We can have ordered and unordered lists combined.

Ordered list <ol></ol>
Most of the browsers default as 1,2,3,4,5...

We have a little more control over ordered lists in terms of things that we can do with it.
- when a count of a certain list starts
- reversed
- type='' can be "i/I/1/A/a"

Choosing between an ordered or unorderer list the primary deciding factor should be the semantics of it - if the sequence of these items matter.

=================
Definition lists
=================

Description lists = definition lists consists of two parts for each item:
- term always come first
- description

Description list <dl></dl>
Term <dt></dt> 
Description <dd></dd>

The browser will render the term as top level items and the description with a little bit of a inset.
