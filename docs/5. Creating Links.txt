<link> element: The link element is used for request external resources for the page.

<a href='seed.html' target='blank' rel='next' title='Planting a Seed'>Planting a Seed</a>

rel=
alternate

=================================
Linking to pages within your site
=================================

It's pretty commeon fot websites that have multiple directories and subdirectories.

/something.html directory
../something.html up one directory
../../something.html up two directories

==========================
Linking to external pages
==========================

Link the site to external links - absolute links
To link a page we need to know the all url for that site. 

Absolute links have to include the protocol in the beginning of it 
ex.
