============================
Exploring the anchor element
============================

<link> element: The link element is used for request external resources for the page.

<a href='seed.html' target='blank' rel='next' title='Planting a Seed'>Planting a Seed</a>

To creat a link on the page we use the anchor element:
<a></a>

href attribute = hypertext reference - tells the browser here do we go when the link is clicked

target attribute - to open a page in a new window or tab, or to control where a page opens within a frame set
target=
_blank
_parent
_self
_top
framename

rel attribute - describes the relationship of the target object to the link object
rel=
alternate
author
bookmark
download
help
license
next
nofollow
noreferrer
prev
search
tag

title attribute - helps make links more accessible wich can be read and interpreted by assistive devices search engines or other content readers.

=================================
Linking to pages within your site
=================================

It's pretty commeon fot websites that have multiple directories and subdirectories.

/something.html directory
../something.html up one directory
../../something.html up two directories

==========================
Linking to external pages
==========================

Link the site to external links - absolute links
To link a page we need to know the full url for that site. 

Absolute links have to include the protocol in the beginning of it 
ex.
http://www.lynda.com

==================================
Linking to downloadable resources
==================================

Give users the ability to download a file or some type of resource from you site.

Simple link syntax combined with the new HTML5 download attribute.

1. Ex. Download the zip file to the PC:
<p>Download our <a href='_assets/syntax.zip' tile='HTML syntax reference'>HTML zip syntax reference!</a></p>

2. Ex. Open the pdf file in the browser
<p>Download our <a href='_assets/syntax.pdf' tile='HTML syntax reference'>HTML pdf syntax reference!</a></p>
Use the download attribute 

3. Ex. The pdf it's force to download. download='name_of_the_document' 
<p>Download our <a href='_assets/syntax.pdf' tile='HTML syntax reference' download='HTML_syntax'>HTML download pdf syntax reference!</a></p>

========================
Linking to page regions
========================

Anchor allows us to jump to specific sections within a document as well - known as fragment identifiers - helpful in enchancing site navigation. 
Let up to jump to sections in the same page and also jump to specific destinations in other pages.

Fragments: 
We need to have an ID on the page so they can jump to the ID attribute that is specify in the link. 

Then: 
<a href='#one' title='section one'>...</a>

To go to another page:
Then <a href='name.html#one' title='go to name'>...</a>

To go to another site:
<a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/browsers.html#scroll-to-fragid' title='W3C Fragment identifiers'>...</a>
We can inspect the element and know the ID.
The url says all that it's need to know

To use fragment identifiers we have to make sure to eliminate any potential confusion that they can cause to the users.
