=============
HTML and CSS
=============

Here HTML capability ends and start CSS.
When we writte CSS we're actually over writting the default styling with the styles that we want. 

CSS = Cascading style sheets

<style> tag says to HTML I want to writte some styles in CSS.

Css pages are made up of rules. 
The rules have selectors.

selector + curly braces + properties + curly braces
body { margin: 0 auto; }

Learning Css is an equally creitical part of learning web design. 

=======================
Creating inline styles
=======================

How they are written and when they are appropriate to use.

Inline styles are styles that are written directly inline in you HTML. And they're applied usually to a single element.

Ex.
<h2 style='color:red;'>Style me using the "style" attribute.</h2>

* property on the left hand  side
* colon to indicate that we're assigning a value
* the value that we want to pass (in this case red)
* a semicolon to let it know that this particular line is over

Inline styles are not very effective way of applying a styling.

==================
The style element
==================

It's a lot more efficient to have styles that can affect an entire page or an entire site all at once.

Use the style element and move the styles to the head of our document.

To target a element in the page we use the selector
- global selector
- class selector

=======================
Controlling typography
=======================

font-family:
font-family: font, fall-back, second fall-back
In the font family we should put more than one because the user can't have that font in the PC so we add two fall-backs.

In the case of "Times New Roman" the name have to appear in quotation marks because the font have more than one name.

font-size:
px - we can use pixels - px
em - we can use a relative unit of measurement they are a little more flexible

font-weight:
by default it's bold, so it's better to set to normal.

font-style:
style of the font.

line-height:
space between the lines.

text-align:
sets the line of the paragrapah should be align.

- Box-Model Properties -
Controls space between the elements
margin:
padding:
border:
top - right - bottom - left

When we put  the elements with diferent properties the more specific rule wins.

=============
Adding color
=============

html is large parent tag and some browsers recognizes that as having intrinsic properties, so it's better to give things like margin and padding.

Hexadecimal notation:
RGB - Red+Green+Blue
Can go from 0 to 255

RGB value:
rgb(red,green,blue)

=====================
Externalizing styles
=====================

Externalizing styles and aplly to multiple pages.
Can't put the styles in the head of a document.

We creat a new text file called styles.css

open a link tag

rel='' attribute - what relationship the resource we bring in has to this page

href='' attribute point to the stylesheet

<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
