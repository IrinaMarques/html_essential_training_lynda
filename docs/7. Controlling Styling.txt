=============
HTML and CSS
=============

Here HTML capability ends and start CSS.
When we writte CSS we're actually over writting the default styling with the styles that we want. 

CSS = Cascading style sheets

<style> tag says to HTML I want to writte some styles in CSS.

Css pages are made up of rules. 
The rules have selectors.

selector + curly braces + properties + curly braces
body { margin: 0 auto; }

Learning Css is an equally creitical part of learning web design. 

=======================
Creating inline styles
=======================

How they are written and when they are appropriate to use.

Inline styles are styles that are written directly inline in you HTML. And they're applied usually to a single element.

Ex.
<h2 style='color:red;'>Style me using the "style" attribute.</h2>

* property on the left hand  side
* colon to indicate that we're assigning a value
* the value that we want to pass (in this case red)
* a semicolon to let it know that this particular line is over

Inline styles are not very effective way of applying a styling.
