=============
HTML and CSS
=============

Here HTML capability ends and start CSS.
When we writte CSS we're actually over writting the default styling with the styles that we want. 

CSS = Cascading style sheets

<style> tag says to HTML I want to writte some styles in CSS.

Css pages are made up of rules. 
The rules have selectors.

selector + curly braces + properties + curly braces
body { margin: 0 auto; }

Learning Css is an equally creitical part of learning web design.
